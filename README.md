📌 PROJECT TITLE:
Telecom Customer Churn Analysis
🎯 OBJECTIVE:
•	The goal of this project is to:
•	Analyse customer churn in the telecom industry.
•	Identify key factors influencing churn rates. This helps businesses improve customer retention by addressing pain points and optimizing service offerings.
•	Develop Retention Strategies.
 📊 DATA SOURCE:
•	Kaggle
🛠️ TOOLS USED:
•	Power BI – For data visualization and dashboard creation
•	Excel/CSV – For initial data storage, cleaning preprocessing and transformation
🔄 STAGES & PROCEDURE:
•	Data Collection- Kaggle
•	Data Cleaning – Handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies
•	Data Analysis – Identifying patterns in churn rates based on demographics, tenure, and service types.
•	Visualization & Dashboarding – Presenting insights using Power BI dashboards
•	Recommendations – Suggesting retention strategies based on findings
🧹 DATA CLEANING:
•	Removing missing or inconsistent data
•	Standardizing formats (e.g., tenure categories: Short, Long, Very Long. Churn: Yes, No)
•	Ensuring customer data integrity and avoiding duplication
📌 BUSINESS QUESTIONS ADDRESSED:
•	Total number of churned customers?
•	 Which customer segments have the highest churn rates? (e.g., gender, tenure length)
•	 What services are most associated with customer churn?
•	 How does tenure length impact churn probability?
•	 What actionable insights can help reduce churn?

INSGHTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Improve Service Offerings and Support
•	Customers without tech support or online security are more likely to churn. Offering free trials or bundling these services with existing plans could increase adoption.
•	Since fiber optic internet has the highest churn rate, assess service quality and address complaints to enhance customer satisfaction.
2. Enhance Customer Engagement and Loyalty
•	Targeted engagement for short-tenure customers: In my visualization i am able to deduced that many customers leave early. Implementing loyalty programs or discounts for long-term commitments can help retain them.
•	Provide special offers for customers using electronic check payments, as they are the largest segment, but possibly less engaged with online features.
3. Address Pricing and Billing Concerns
•	High monthly charges might be contributing to churn. Offer flexible payment plans, discounts for longer commitments, or tiered pricing to better match customer budgets.
•	Encourage more paperless billing adoption by providing incentives like small monthly discounts.
4. Improve Customer Support and Experience
•	The number of tech support tickets suggests some customers face unresolved issues. Investing in better self-service options, chatbots, and faster response times could improve satisfaction.
•	Train support teams to proactively address common complaints related to internet services and contract terms.
